There are also some interesting operations available for strings in Python. One of them is concatenating strings, which means gluing one string to another. In Python, it can be easily done with + sign (ensure that both sides must be either both strings or numbers)

Also, you can easily calculate the number of each symbol met in your row. Use s.count(x) to do it where s - is a variable where string stores and x - symbol you are interested in.

Also, you can replicate one string multiple times by just using multiplication. string * n will produce n copies of string.
